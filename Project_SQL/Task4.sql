-- Task 4: Detecting Anomalies in Sales Transactions
-- firstly Calculate Average Sales per Product Line 
with average_sales as (
select 'product line', avg(total) as avg_sales from walmartsales group by 'product line'),
-- now detect anomalies
anomalies as (
select 'invoice id', 'product line', total, avg_sales, case
when total > (avg_sales * 1.5) then 'High Anomaly'
when total < (avg_sales * 0.5) then 'Low Anomaly'
else 'Normal'
end as anomaly_type from walmartsales join average_sales using ('product line'))
select 'invoice id', 'product line', total, avg_sales, anomaly_type from anomalies
order by anomaly_type desc;
