# 🚗🔋 Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) data using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy. The goal is to uncover insights, detect unusual data points (outliers), conduct hypothesis testing, and make actionable recommendations for EV buyers and manufacturers.

## ✅ Tasks Covered  

### ✅ Task 1: EV Filtering & Grouping  
- Filter EVs within **350,000 PLN** budget with **minimum 400 km range**.
- Group these EVs by manufacturer.
- Calculate **average battery capacity** per manufacturer.

### ✅ Task 2: Outlier Detection  
- Analyze energy consumption (kWh/100 km).
- Identify **unusually high/low consumption** using IQR (Interquartile Range).

### ✅ Task 3: Battery Capacity vs Range Analysis  
- Scatter plot to visualize relationship.
- Key insights about battery size and driving range.

### ✅ Task 4: EV Recommendation System  
- Built a **Python class** to recommend top 3 EVs based on user’s:
    - Budget
    - Minimum required range
    - Minimum required battery capacity

### ✅ Task 5: Hypothesis Testing  
- Compared **average engine power** of **Tesla vs Audi** using:
    - Two-sample **t-test** (`ttest_ind` from scipy.stats).
- Provided **insights and recommendations** based on test results.

## 📊 Insights from Analysis  

🔋 **Bigger Battery = Longer Range** (Strong Positive Correlation)  
⚠️ However, some EVs with large batteries had lower than expected range — indicating inefficiency, higher weight, or poor aerodynamics.

📊 **Tesla vs Audi - Engine Power**  
- No **statistically significant difference** between their average engine power.
- Customers should focus more on **range, charging speed, and interior quality** rather than power alone.

⚡ **Outliers in Energy Consumption**  
- Some EVs consumed much more energy than average — these are potential **red flags** for buyers.

## 💡 Recommendations  

### 📣 For Manufacturers  
- Focus marketing on **range, charging speed, and efficiency** rather than just power.
- Work on improving **battery efficiency** and vehicle aerodynamics.

### 📣 For Customers  
- Long-distance drivers should focus on **high battery capacity + efficient design**.
- City commuters can save money by choosing **smaller, cost-effective EVs**.
- Look for **independent reviews** that test real-world range.
